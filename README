kiterm -- browser-based terminal for the kindle

This package is a simplified and stripped down port of the AjaxTerm
program that is suitable for operation on the Kindle.

AjaxTerm uses some simple javascript on the client to access a
server in charge of forking shells (and keeping them alive)
and pass tty data across the HTTP connection.
This approach is especially useful on the kindle, where
running an xterm or a shell in console mode is challenging.
Instead, the browser can be used for this.

The original AjaxTerm uses a Python script, with the usual amount
of classes, to implement its services.
I have completely reimplemented the program in C, using a
single process that handles multiple connections and forks
the child shells as desired.
The javascript has also been heavily simplified, removing
unnecessary libraries.

The tarball includes:
+ this README
+ myts.c (source code for the server)
+ myts.arm	-- a version of the server compiled for the kindle
+ ajaxterm.{html,js,css},		html files

To use the program you must run the server from the
directory where the javascript files are, and then
launch a browser to

	 http://localhost:8022/

On the kindle, ALT maps to CTRL, and the ESC key is the
"page back" key on the left of the screen.

TODO:
At this stage the program is still a bit experimental in that it
still needs work on two areas, namely process management
and terminal emulation. In particular:

    + complete ANSI control code emulation
	not all ANSI sequences are recognised, though
	most things work (top, vi, ...). The missing sequences
	mostly refer to color handling.

    + reconnect to existing sessions
	at the moment each session uses a random key so
	if the browser dies or disconnects, you cannot
	reach the existing session anymore

    + session termination
	shells remain alive until the server terminates.
	I should implement a way to explicitly kill
	a session or connect to one of the existing ones.
